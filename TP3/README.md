## Project information

- Strong Points
  - You can change the camera and piece animation behaviour.
  - You can change the piece shape.
  - Animation between two cameras.
  - Scoreboard displays both total game wins and current game points.
  - Third camera has a top view of the board to allow the player to more easily see the board when the stacks get taller.
  - The game cameras are created according to the board position, making it easier to reposition the gameboard in a scene.
- Scenes
  - The first scene is in an alien planet with just the board on a wooden surface.
  - The second scene is in the boat scene used for TP2, with the board on one of the boat's seats.
  - The third scene is in an aeroplane hangar with a table and two chairs.

## Issues/Problems

- The player camera switching sometimes switches to the wrong camera, this does not affect gameplay however.
- Changing scene in the middle of a move animation leaves the game stuck.
